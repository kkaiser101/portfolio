# Portfolio

## Description

The motivation for building this project was to create a portfolio for myself to show to the world what amazing projects I will be working on in the future to show potential employers. This page will eventually allow potential employers to see the work I have done in order to show them what I am capable of as a programmer. 

## Usage

Clicking on the tabs at the top of the page will automatically scroll the page down to that section.

## Credits

Thank you to the U of A bootcamp for teaching me how to make this portfolio! I look forward to continue making use of the new skills as I learn along!
